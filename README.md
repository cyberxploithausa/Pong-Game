## About the Game

Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. The objective is to score points by bouncing a ball back and forth between the paddles. This project recreates that nostalgic gameplay in Python.

## How to Play

- Player 1 (left paddle) controls: `W` (up) and `S` (down).
- Player 2 (right paddle) controls: `Up arrow` (up) and `Down arrow` (down).

The game continues until one player reaches the score limit (typically 5 or 10).
