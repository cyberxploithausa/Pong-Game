## About the Game

Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. The objective is to score points by bouncing a ball back and forth between the paddles. This project recreates that nostalgic gameplay in Python.

## How to Play

- Player 1 (left paddle) controls: `W` (up) and `S` (down).
- Player 2 (right paddle) controls: `Up arrow` (up) and `Down arrow` (down).

The game continues until one player reaches the score limit (typically 5 or 10).

## Getting Started

To run the Pong game locally or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pong-game-python.git
